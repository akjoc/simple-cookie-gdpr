# Simple Cookie GDPR 

Welcome to the Simple Cookie GDPR! This is a very lightweight WordPress plugin that helps website owners comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) by providing an easy-to-use solution for managing cookie consent.

## Description

## Features

- **Customizable Banner**: Modify the look and text of the banner to fit your website.
- **Adjustable Cookie Settings**: Visitors can accept all cookies, reject non-essential ones, or set their preferences.
- **Admin Settings Panel**: Easily configure the banner, manage cookie information, and customize button texts from the WordPress admin area.
- **Dynamic Cookie Settings**: Add and describe different types of cookies, and let visitors toggle their consent.

## Installation

1. **Upload the Plugin Files**
   - Download the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository.
   - Go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`, and select the downloaded ZIP file.
   - Activate the plugin after the upload is complete.

2. **Manual Installation**
   - Unzip the downloaded plugin file.
   - Upload the `simple-cookie-gdpr` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.
